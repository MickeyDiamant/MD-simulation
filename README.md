MD-simulation
=============

Source files of md simulation for PhD


The code includes just the source files for a simlple molacular dynamics simulation of a single atom over an FCC lattice.
The interaction between lattice atoms is modeled using nearest neighbors harmonic potential. The interaction of he adsorbate
atom with lattice atoms is modeled with a Morse like potential.
